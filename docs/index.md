# Freestyle Rhyme

## Project Description
 
* The purpose of this app is to create a rhyme generator for when you are freestyling, and you get stuck, or run out of rhymes and need ideas. This app will rhyme single words or last words of sentences to keep in the format of freestyling. It will also have a random rhyme/topic generator to help stimulate ideas and subject matter to rap about. This app can be used for different purposes as well for example it could be used as just a simple rhyme generator or for writing poems.

## Intended functionality
* The user will have the ability to enter in a word and it will bring up a list of words that rhyme with the entered word.

* The user will be able to enter in lines of words or "bars", and it will take the last word and rhyme it together keeping the format of freestlying. 

* The user will be able to hit a random topic button, and it will bring up a random topic.

* The user will be able to hit a random word button, and it will bring up a random word to rhyme with.

* This app can be used for much more than freestyling. For example it can be used to help write song or poems.

## Cloud or device-based services or data

* Rhyme Api, https://rhymebrain.com/api.html
> This service will be used to bring all the rhyme data. The app will not function without access to this Api.

* Microphone access, https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MicrophoneInfo?hl=en
> Microphone access will be used to say words instead of typing them. The app will work fully without access to this feature.

* Google sign in, https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/
> Google sign in will be used to access stored data through each account. This will give the user the ability to remember recent words used. The app will work without access to Google sign in. However, it will not have the ability to remember recent words used.
